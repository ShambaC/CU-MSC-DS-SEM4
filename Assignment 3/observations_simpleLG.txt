Key Observations from Simple Linear Regression Analysis:

- Coefficient Accuracy: Our custom gradient descent implementation achieves coefficients nearly identical to sklearn's implementation across all features, with differences typically in the range of 10^-6 to 10^-8.

- Feature Importance:
Median income shows the strongest relationship with house values (~40k increase per income unit)
Housing age has the weakest relationship
Population exhibits a slight negative relationship with housing prices

- Baseline Values: Intercepts around 120k-170k indicate the baseline house price independent of feature variation.

- Normalization Impact: Without normalization, features with large scales (total_rooms, population) caused numerical instability in gradient descent. Normalization was essential for algorithm stability.
